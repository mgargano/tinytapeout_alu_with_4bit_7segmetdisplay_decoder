# TinyTapeout project information
#
# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# This will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "4-bit ALU with 7 segment display decoder hexadecimal output"      # Project title
  description:  "a 4-bit ALU with 8 different possible operations on an internal accumulator whose current 4-bit state is displayed in hexadecimal on the segmented display"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "3-bit decoder picks operation pass-through, bit-wise (NOT, AND, OR, XOR), two's complement, add, or subtract circuit based on selection and stores the result in a 4-bit accumulator, after the pressing the step button, the 4-bit to 7-segment display decoder circuits then take that value and display it hexadecimal"      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "select one of the 8 alu operations [switches 4-2] (pass-through 0, bit-wise NOT 1, bit-wise AND 2, bit-wise OR 3, bit-wise XOR 4, add 5, two's compliment 6, subtract 7) then input a 4-bit number [switches 8-5], press step button to perform the selected computation and the display will indicate current 4-bit accumulator value in hex, dot indicates if a carry is output during addition or subtraction"      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "None"      # Describe any external hardware needed
